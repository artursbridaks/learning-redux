**Learning Redux**

Short and easy example saved and used for learning purpose. Perhaps might come in handy as a little example for a larger future project. Might eventually add more detailed commentary and expand it to make it more difficult. I used React, Redux and Redux Dev Tools for this mini project.

**To run the site:**

* Clone the app to your local machine
* Open the terminal from the project folder and enter:
    * Or open the Visual Studio Code inner terminal and enter:
* npm start
* The browser should open automatically and the app will be ready to use

**Notes**

Of course, I followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY) but tried to think ahead to learn more effectively. Have to stay true to myself. Anyways, much more to learn in the future.
